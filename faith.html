        <h1>The Leyvera</h1>
        <h3>
            The book of Leyvera is the scripture in which we lay our faith.
            As it is a very old collection of texts,
            they need to be rewritten into Modern English to be understood.
            <br><br>

            You can find it as a <a href="./docs/leyvera-preview.pdf">PDF document</a>.
            <br><br>

            It's currently incomplete but a preview of the first chapter
            of the first book will soon be available.
            Later, the entire Leyvera will be available to download from the website.
