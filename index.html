        Welcome to the Church of Elohym.<br>
        Join our community in search for comfort through our Lady.

        We seek to honour our Mother and Her Daughter,<br>
        and to live righteously by the Light.

      <h3>
        We believe that Elohym, the Mother created the universe and that She brought about
        Elith, the Daughter, she who gave us hearts with which to love and to be loved.<br>
        By following Her word and way, we can find peace within ourselves and with our fellow kin;
        And by walking as the Light leads, we shall be righteous and reasonable.
        <br><br>

      <h1>Join the community</h1>
      <h3>
        As we do each other, we'll support you in your search for happiness
        and to feel fullfilled. Come be a part of our community, our family,
        and together stride with us. We shall find the light at the end of
        the tunnel; She will guide us there.

        As a first step, you can head over to our
        <a style="color: #4267b2; text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.facebook.com/churchofelohym">Facebook page</a>
        and follow it; then should enough people come along, we can justify opening a group.
      </h3>

      <h3>
        Unlike some churches, where you might have been hurt or rejected,
        we give everyone a chance. If you're of the GRSM <i>("Gender, Sexual, and Romantic Minorities", or LGBT)</i>,
        you don't need to fear being shunned; you're as welcomed as any.
